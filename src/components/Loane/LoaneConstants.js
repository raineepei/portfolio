      description:"I worked primarily as a UX/UI designer and front-end developer for the duration of our project, working closely with Adobe XD and React Native. I also dabbled in some back-end development, which exposed me to some Firebase. This internship was my first exposure to front-end development and UX/UI design aspects of app development. It pushed me to learn new development frameworks (React Native) and the necessary tools/skills needed for UX/UI design (Adobe XD, wireframing, protoyping, etc.), all within a span of 10 weeks.",
