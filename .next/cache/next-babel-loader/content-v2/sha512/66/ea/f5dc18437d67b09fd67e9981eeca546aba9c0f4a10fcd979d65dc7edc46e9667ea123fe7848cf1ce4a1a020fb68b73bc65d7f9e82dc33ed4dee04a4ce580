My Role:\n        </SectionTitleDescription1>\n        <SectionTitleDescription1>\n            For this project (Jun 2021 - Sep 2021), I was a UX Researcher; my primary responsibilities were to set up interview and testing guidelines, spearhead \n            the research and interview process, build out testing plans and test-subject recruitment, and pull key insights to help inform \n            design decisions. I collaborated with the UX Designers when developing interview guidelines for testing prototypes and had my \n            other team mebers members help me with conducting interviews and surveys. Given the time frame, it was important to quickly figure\n            out the questions our team needed answers to and the insights I needed to learn from research.\n        </SectionTitleDescription1>\n        <LinkColor href='https://www.kinikoffeesd.com/'>\n            <ToWebsite>\n                Check out the website here!\n            </ToWebsite>\n        </LinkColor>\n\n        <SectionTitleIntro>\n            RESEARCH STATEMENT AND GOALS\n        </SectionTitleIntro>\n        <SectionTitleDescription1>\n            After meeting with our client, we learned that Kini Koffee wants to be portrayed as a \"fun, beachy, creative\" coffee shop for \n            people aged ~16-20 years old. With this in mind, I focused on user surveys and customer interviews to find out what other people \n            think of the brand through reviews first and figure out what questions our temas need answered and what insights we hope to learn.\n            To address both customer and our client needs, we created two problem statements that encompassed our goals for this project.\n        </SectionTitleDescription1>\n        <SectionProblem style={{marginTop: '30px'}}> \n            <SectionTitleIntroProblem>\n                Business Problem Statement\n            </SectionTitleIntroProblem>\n            <SectionTitleDescriptionProblem>\n                Kini Koffee needs a place where all their information is centralized so customers can easily learn more about the business, \n                drinks, and prices.   \n            </SectionTitleDescriptionProblem>\n            <SectionTitleIntroProblem>\n                Customer Problem Statement\n            </SectionTitleIntroProblem>\n            <SectionTitleDescriptionProblem>\n                People who are looking for coffee shops in the Del Mar area need access to attractive, unique features about Kini Koffee to \n                encourage them to go there over any other coffee shop in the area.\n            </SectionTitleDescriptionProblem>\n        </SectionProblem>\n\n        <SectionTitleIntro>\n            GETTING TO KNOW OUR USERS\n        </SectionTitleIntro>\n        <SectionTitleDescription1 style={{color: '#D82682', fontWeight: 'bold'}}>\n            1. We surveyed 60 users (most in our target demographic) on their outlook on small coffee shops.\n        </SectionTitleDescription1>\n        <SectionTitleDescription1 style={{fontWeight: 'bold'}}>\n            Sample Survey Questions:\n        </SectionTitleDescription1>\n        <GridContainer>\n            <ImgSurvey src='../../images/Kini/samplesurvey1.png' />\n            <ImgSurvey src='../../images/Kini/samplesurvey2.png' />\n        </GridContainer>\n        <SectionTitleDescription1>\n            Allowing the user to sort their preference in finding these pieces of information helped us determine the information architecture of \n            the website design; how can we design the website to allow users to access the information they need without having them think too \n            hard about where to look. Eventually, we want to tie this in with what we want the user’s first impression of Kini Koffee to be the moment they see the site.\n        </SectionTitleDescription1>\n        <SectionTitleDescription1 style={{color: '#D82682', fontWeight: 'bold', marginTop: '15px'}}>\n            2.

It consolidated information from our feature testing, A/B usability \n            testing, and prototype-specific questions. Sorting feedback on each prototype into suggestions, expectations, likes, and confusions helped the\n            designers decide which features from each prototype we want to implement into the final prototype, and what additional features we want to add.\n        </SectionTitleDescription1>\n        <SectionTitleDescription1>\n            For example, for Prototype B, some likes include:\n        </SectionTitleDescription1>\n        <DescriptionIndented>\n            → The menu is better for finding prices and sizes\n        </DescriptionIndented>\n        <DescriptionIndented>\n            → Users can see that Kini Koffee specialises in drinks\n        </DescriptionIndented>\n        <DescriptionIndented>\n            → TThe menu promotes specials first\n        </DescriptionIndented>\n        <DescriptionIndented>\n            → There is less scrolling\n        </DescriptionIndented>\n        <DescriptionIndented>\n            → There are home page buttons to view the menu and to order online\n        </DescriptionIndented>\n        <SectionTitleDescription1>\n            These synthesized results helped the designers decide that they would prefer to use Prototype’s B menu layout in the final prototype.\n        </SectionTitleDescription1>\n        <ImgFeatureSorting src='../../images/Kini/figjam.png'/>\n        <LinkColor href='https://www.figma.com/file/P5nTPbn6jvE0K5kycZIStw/Research-Synthesis?node-id=0%3A1'>\n            <LinkDoc>\n                FigJam File\n            </LinkDoc>\n        </LinkColor>\n\n\n\n        <SectionTitleIntro>\n            REFLECTIONS\n        </SectionTitleIntro>\n        <SectionTitleDescription1 style={{fontWeight: 'bold', fontStyle: 'italic', color: '#D82682'}}>\n            To summarize my experience:\n        </SectionTitleDescription1>\n        <DescriptionIndented>\n            1. Working with an actual stakeholder is a much different experience than working on a school  project; learning to collaborate, communicate, \n            and compromise with the client was a learning curve. The design process is very nuanced, and changes with each team and project you work with.\n        </DescriptionIndented>\n        <DescriptionIndented>\n            2. UX Research is the foundation of the design process. Without proper research, its easy to stray off track during the design process and \n            start designing for the “wrong” problem. Research guides the designs and allows us to approach the problem intuitively and effectively based \n            on both our client and customers.\n        </DescriptionIndented>\n        <DescriptionIndented>\n            3. It is more important to be able to analyze and synthesize the data you obtain during the research process. How can we utilize this \n            information to guide us towards our designs or redesigns?\n        </DescriptionIndented>\n        <SectionTitleDescription1 style={{fontWeight: 'bold', fontStyle: 'italic', color: '#D82682'}}>\n            Thank You To:\n        </SectionTitleDescription1>\n        <DescriptionIndented>\n            My extremely talented team members: Stella Seki, Deepika Vuppala, Edward De Leon, Chynna Tumalad,\n        </DescriptionIndented>\n        <DescriptionIndented>\n            Our Mentors: Jennie Yoon, Lily Konings, and Bryant Lim,\n        </DescriptionIndented>\n        <DescriptionIndented>\n            Our user test participants,\n        </DescriptionIndented>\n        <DescriptionIndented>\n            Jewell, our client who kept us well-caffeinated with Kini Koffee's amazing drinks,\n        </DescriptionIndented>\n        <DescriptionIndented>\n            And the Power Up Team, for putting together this opportunity!\n        </DescriptionIndented>\n\n        <LinkColor href='/#projects' style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>\n            <GoBackButton>\n                GO BACK\n            </GoBackButton>\n    </LinkColor>\n\n    </Layout>\n\n);\n  \nexport default Kini;"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
