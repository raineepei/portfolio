were to set up interview and testing guidelines, spearhead \n            the research and interview process, build out testing plans and test-subject recruitment, and pull key insights to help inform \n            design decisions. I collaborated with the UX Designers when developing interview guidelines for testing prototypes and had my \n            other team mebers members help me with conducting interviews and surveys. Given the time frame, it was important to quickly figure\n            out the questions our team needed answers to and the insights I needed to learn from research.\n        </SectionTitleDescription1>\n\n        <SectionTitleIntro>\n            RESEARCH STATEMENT AND GOALS\n        </SectionTitleIntro>\n        <SectionTitleDescription1>\n            After meeting with our client, we learned that Kini Koffee wants to be portrayed as a \"fun, beachy, creative\" coffee shop for \n            people aged ~16-20 years old. With this in mind, I focused on user surveys and customer interviews to find out what other people \n            think of the brand through reviews first and figure out what questions our temas need answered and what insights we hope to learn.\n            To address both customer and our client needs, we created two problem statements that encompassed our goals for this project.\n        </SectionTitleDescription1>\n        <SectionProblem style={{marginTop: '30px'}}> \n            <SectionTitleIntroProblem>\n                Business Problem Statement\n            </SectionTitleIntroProblem>\n            <SectionTitleDescriptionProblem>\n                Kini Koffee needs a place where all their information is centralized so customers can easily learn more about the business, \n                drinks, and prices.   \n            </SectionTitleDescriptionProblem>\n            <SectionTitleIntroProblem>\n                Customer Problem Statement\n            </SectionTitleIntroProblem>\n            <SectionTitleDescriptionProblem>\n                People who are looking for coffee shops in the Del Mar area need access to attractive, unique features about Kini Koffee to \n                encourage them to go there over any other coffee shop in the area.\n            </SectionTitleDescriptionProblem>\n        </SectionProblem>\n\n        <SectionTitleIntro>\n            GETTING TO KNOW OUR USERS\n        </SectionTitleIntro>\n        <SectionTitleDescription1 style={{color: '#D82682', fontWeight: 'bold'}}>\n            1.
