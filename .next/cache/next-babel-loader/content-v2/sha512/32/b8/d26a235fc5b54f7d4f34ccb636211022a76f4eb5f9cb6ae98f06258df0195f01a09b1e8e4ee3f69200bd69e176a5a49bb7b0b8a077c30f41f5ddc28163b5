Since we had also scrapped certain setting options, such as being able to change the theme or turn on notifications, I was able to move the leftover settings onto the profile page. Side note, another cool implementation I worked on was to use an expo module, expo-image-picker, to allow users to choose a profile picture from their camera roll, which would then be stored in firebase so it would appear each time they  are logged in.
